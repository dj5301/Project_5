# Problem 1

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # to replicate the result
```

# 1) single simulation：given n people，is there any same day birthday by two people? (TRUE=there is at least one pair)

```{r}
has_match_once <- function(n) {
  
  bdays <- sample.int(365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  anyDuplicated(bdays) > 0
  
}
```

# 2) For n=2..50，Every n repeat 10000 times and estimate the probability
```{r}
ns <- 2:50
n_trials <- 10000
```


# 3) use replicate() + mean() to calculate every n's probability
```{r}
prob_sim <- sapply(ns, function(n) {
  
  mean(replicate(n_trials, has_match_once(n)))
  
})
```


# 4) The probability that "no one has the same birthday".
```{r}
prob_exact <- 1 - sapply(ns, function(n) {
  
  if (n > 365) return(0)              
  prod((365:(365 - n + 1)) / 365)    
  
})
```


# 5) Create a dataframe for plot
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  n     = ns,
  sim   = prob_sim,
  exact = prob_exact
)
```

# 6) Use ggplot to visualize the result
```{r}
birthday_plot <-
ggplot(df, aes(n, sim)) +
   geom_point() + geom_line() +
   geom_line(aes(y = exact), linetype = 2) +
   labs(x = "population n", y = "At least two people has same birthday",
       title = "Birthday Problem: estimate simulation vs theoritical value (All 365 days, Uniform distribution)",
        subtitle = paste0("replicated n ", n_trials, " times")) +
   theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

birthday_plot
```
Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size, and comment on your results.

# Problem 3

# Load Data
```{r message = FALSE}
h <- read_csv("homicide-data.csv")
```
One row per homicide case from 50 significant U.S. cities is in the raw dataset.
Some major variables are:

Variable Description 
uid: Unique identification for each homicide case 
reported_date: Homicide report date
victim_last, victim_first: Name of victim
victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex: Demographic data
city, state: city and state of the homicide 
lat, lon: Location of incident
disposition: Case status (“Closed by arrest”, “Open/No arrest”, “Closed without arrest”).

For this project, unsolved killings have:

"Closed without arrest"
"Open/No arrest"


# Create city_state variable and define "unsolved" categories
```{r}
h <- h %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = "_"))

unsolved_levels <- c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")
```



# Summarize within each city
```{r}
city_summary <- h %>%
  mutate(unsolved = disposition %in% unsolved_levels) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    total = n(),
    unsolved = sum(unsolved)
  )

city_summary
```

# Filter for Baltimore
```{r}
bal <- city_summary %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD")

bal_test <- prop.test(bal$unsolved, bal$total)

bal_tidy <- tidy(bal_test)

# Extract key results
bal_estimate <- bal_tidy$estimate
bal_ci_lower <- bal_tidy$conf.low
bal_ci_upper <- bal_tidy$conf.high

bal_tidy
```
The projected percentage of unsolved killings in Baltimore, MD is `r baltimore_estimate$estimate`. 
The 95% confidence interval is (`r baltimore_estimate$conf.low`, `r baltimore_estimate$conf.high`)



# Function to run prop.test for one row
```{r}
run_test <- function(unsolved, total) {
  
  tidy(prop.test(unsolved, total))
  
}
```

# Apply to ALL cities
```{r}
city_results <- city_summary %>%
  mutate(test = map2(unsolved, total, run_test)) %>%
  unnest(test) %>%
  select(city_state, total, unsolved, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

city_results
```

# Visualize the result
```{r}
city_results %>%
  arrange(estimate) %>%
  mutate(city_state = factor(city_state, levels = city_state)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicides by City",
    x = "City",
    y = "Estimated proportion unsolved (95% CI)"
  ) +
